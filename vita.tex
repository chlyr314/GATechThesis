\end{center}
Charilaos Lyritsakis was born in Heraklion of Crete, Greece, on March 16, 1990. 
He obtained his Engineer's Degree in Civil Engineering from National Technical 
University of Athens (N.T.U.A.), Greece, in 2015 with specialization in 
Structural and Earthquake Engineering. From 2015 to 2017 he enrolled in the 
interdisciplinary postgraduate programme "Analysis and Design of Earthquake 
Resistant Structures" in N.T.U.A and earned his Master of Science Degree in May 
of 2017. Since September of 2017, Charilaos Lyritsakis has been a Ph.D. student 
at the Pennsylvania State University in the Department of Civil and 
Environmental Engineering. His academic advisor was Dr. Kostas 
Papakonstantinou. His research work was supported by the U.S. National Science 
Foundation under grant No. 1634575 and focused on developing a hybrid beam 
finite element for general nonlinear analysis and incorporating it in a 
nonlinear optimization framework. Other topics explored during this 
collaboration and incorporated in the project were return mapping algorithms 
for rate-independent elastoplasticity, numerical continuation algorithms, 
global and parametric nonlinear programming frameworks.
