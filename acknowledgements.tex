I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Dr. Kostas Papakonstantinou, my 
academic advisor and chair of my doctoral committee, for his guidance, 
encouragement and valuable assistance throughout for all these years. Without 
his guidance, this work would not have come into fruition and for that I am 
deeply grateful.

Special thanks are owed to the rest members of the dissertation committee, Dr. 
Gordon Warn, Dr. Pinley Chen, Dr. Tong Qiu and Dr. Reuben Kraft, for their 
participation, advice and suggestions in completeling this task. I would also 
like to thank my friend and colleague Dr. Charalampos Andriotis for all his 
helpful suggestions and important contributions early on in this endeavor.

I cannot conclude this acknowledgement without expressing my deep gratitude to 
my parents, Claire and Michael, to whom this dissertation is dedicated. They  
have always been by my side and their encouragement, love and unwavering 
support, without which none of this would have been possible.
