\chapter{Introduction and Background}


\subsection{Notation}
Unless state otherwise, boldface lowercase letters indicate second order 
tensor. Wherever 
the same letters appear with an overhead arrow, this indicates the vector 
notation for the tensor represented with that letter. The convention adopted 
herein for storing second order tensors in a vector object is the following:
\begin{equation*}
	\boldsymbol{\sigma} = \begin{bmatrix}
		\sigma_{11} & \sigma_{12} & \sigma_{13} \\
		\sigma_{12} & \sigma_{22} & \sigma_{23} \\
		\sigma_{13} & \sigma_{23} & \sigma_{33} \\
	\end{bmatrix}\rightarrow \bvec{\sigma} = \begin{bmatrix}
		\sigma_{11} & \sigma_{22} & \sigma_{33} & \sigma_{12} & \sigma_{23} & 
		\sigma_{13}
	\end{bmatrix}^T
\end{equation*}

For strain tensors, components for which $i\neq j$ are multiplied by 2.

In addition, any boldface letter, lowercase or uppercase, with an overhead 
arrow indicates a vector object. In constrast, matrices are represented 
exclusively by uppercase, non-italic, boldface letters. Finally, normal font 
letters indicate scalar quantities.
