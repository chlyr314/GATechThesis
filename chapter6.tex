\chapter{Conclusions and Future Study}

%%%%%%%%% HYBRID BEAM
 Future directions\textbf{BEAM} 
can include investigation of different nonlinear programming solution schemes,
as well as further extensions of the formulation in order to support additional 
features, such as initially curved elements, dynamic effects, and three 
dimensional settings that necessitate special treatment of the rotational field.



%%%%%%%%%% WLS PREDICTOR FUTURE
Directions
for future research on this topic\textbf{WLS predictor} include investigations 
on the effect of
the weighting function, the potential use of the local approximation in the
adjustment of the fitting and prediction parameters of the framework, or even
the step-length, during the continuation process.
